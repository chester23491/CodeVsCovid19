# How to play

You need to be four people to play the game. After creating a group you can select your seat to start the game. Then simply click on the card you want to play and after everyone has played the winner can claim the cards by clicking on them in the top right corner. The web app works best in Chrome.

# How can I further improve the project

The API is in the engine file. Where we access the mysql website.

The frontend it implemented in public_html/game folder, where one can edit the assets/js/player.js file to improve the game logic.
